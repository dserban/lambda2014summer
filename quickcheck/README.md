To install Flask (a Python-based web development framework necessary for this exercise), run the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install flask
```

Then, start the Python server with:

```
python sha512sum.py
```

You should then see this output:

```
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/
 * Restarting with reloader
```
